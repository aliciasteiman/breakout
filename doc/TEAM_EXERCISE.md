# Teamwork Exercise
### Alicia Steiman and Suomo Ammah

## Round 1

 * How did it feel to be in a team when one person is more capable than the other?
 
 Being in a team where one person is more capable than the other provides opportunities for learning. The 
 person with greater capabilities can share their perspective and help the other complete the task successfully
 and efficiently.

## Round 2

Notice if you feel resentful, frustrated, proud, confident, etc.

 * How did it feel when you are having an easier time than your partner with the task?
 
 Although we both had a fairly easy time with the task, it was exciting when the other was doing well because 
 it meant we were succeeding as a group. Seeing the other person succeed made me want to work harder in order
 to keep up. 

 * How did it feel when you are having a harder time than your partner?
 
 When having a harder time, it was frustrating to not be able to sort the candy as fast. I wanted to know how
 the other person could sort so quickly and was concerned that my method was not working as well. 

## Round 3

 * Did you ask for help when you need it? Did you offer?
 
 We did not explicitly ask for help during the task but we offered advice between tasks on better ways to sort. 
 In hindsight we could have offered to help during the task, but we both interpreted the rules as having to do it
 ourselves.

 * How do you offer help without offending? How do you ask for help without guilt?
 
 Offering help without offending typically depends on the wording, especially if it is online or over text because it
 can be read poorly. Making sure the offer is not criticizing also helps to avoid offending the other person. Knowing 
 that asking for help doesn't mean you are less capable helps mitigate feelings of guilt. Being able to build a 
 relationship with your partner so that no one feels guilty or offended is also essential when asking each other for
 help. 

 * What would it feel like if one partner took over and did the entire task, leaving you out?
 
 For this task specifically, feelings probably wouldn't have been hurt, but for a coding project it would not feel as
 fun anymore. It would make the partner left out feel inadequate because it may come across as the other partner
 not valuing their work or contributions. 

## Round 4

 * How did you and your partner get better with the task over time?
 
 During the task and after each round, my partner and I talked strategy and compared our methods for sorting. We
 talked about the differences in our methods when using our dominant and non-dominant hands so that the other 
 person could succeed in the next round.
